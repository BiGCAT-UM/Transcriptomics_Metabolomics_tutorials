## Gene-Rare Disease-Provenance linksets

**The Gene-Rare Disease-Provenance Linksets<br/>**
This dataset provides a CyTargetlinker compatible linkset to link monogenic, rare diseases (annotated with their OMIM identifier) with a known genetic cause (annotated with their HGNC, Ensembl identifiers) supplemented with manually extracted provenance of both the disease and the discovery of the underlying genetic cause of the disease (PMID).

Gene-Rare Disease Association Provenance - A dataset for bioinformatics application. Friederike Ehrhart, Egon L. Willighagen, Martina Kutmon, Max van Hoften, Leopold G.M. Curfs, Chris T. Evelo.<br/>
